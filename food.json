It's used in meats not only to enhance flavor and add color but also as a preservative to prevent bacterial growth and spoilage.  Sodium nitrate in food is an additive that is considered safe by U.S. government standards. However, when sodium nitrate interacts with bacteria in meat, it changes chemically, loses one oxygen and becomes sodium nitrite.  These two different preservatives are found in processed meats like bacon, lunch meat, and hot dogs. They're some of the worst offenders, and they're believed to cause colon cancer and metabolic syndrome, which can lead to diabetes. ",
